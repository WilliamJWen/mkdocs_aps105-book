# Principles of using this textbook

## Embedded Code üíª 

```{code-block} c
Code will appear in boxes like these. 

You can copy code by hovering on this box and pressing on the button at the top right. 
```

You can also download the `.c` file of the program by clicking on file name in text. For example, download {download}`hello-world.c <../../code/chapter1/hello-world/hello-world.c>` if you want to edit the code yourself. If it opens a new window with contents of the file, right-click on the page and select Save As. You can choose where you want to save the file. Please make sure it is saved as `.c` file not `.txt` file.

Example or potential output to the code will be shown as in the following example.

## Exercises üèã

Every chapter will have an exercises section. This section will include past exams questions related to the concepts discussed in the chapter (or previous chapters). Some may be marked as **[Easy]**, **[Intermediate]** or **[Challenging]**. The difficulty level is subjective and may vary from person to person. I expect you to solve these exercises after we cover the chapter in the lectures.

These exercises will have solutions that will be hidden and you need to click to show the answer. For example,
