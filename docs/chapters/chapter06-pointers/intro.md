# Pointers

In the previous chapter, we discussed functions, and how can we pass to a function one or more **values** and only return one **value**. We mentioned that variables within each function can only be accessed within a function, and only values were passed to and from functions. In this chapter, we discuss how can we access variables in other functions, and enhance the communication between functions more.
