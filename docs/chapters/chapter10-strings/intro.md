# Strings

Throughout this book, we study different data types. None of the data types discussed before stores a word or sentence, because in C programming language there is no data type that stores a word/sentence. 

A word or sentence is considered a string, and to store a string in C programming language, we store it in an array of null-terminated characters. In this chapter, we discuss strings in C, how can we read strings from the user and print them to the user, and finally string functions that help us do operations on strings.
