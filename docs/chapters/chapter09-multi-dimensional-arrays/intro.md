# Multi-dimensional Arrays

In the previous two chapters, we discuss one-dimensional arrays. One-dimensional arrays help in writing down a list of items that relate to one thing, for example, the grades of one student, or the grades of a class in one assignment. It is more powerful if we can write down the grades of all students in all course assessments. This would look like a multi-column table like this:

|Student Name[^1]|Lab 1 |Lab 2 |Lab 3 |Lab 4 |Lab 5 |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Muhammad Ali   |  10  |  9   |  10  |  10  |  9   |
| Whitney Houston|  7   |  10  |  1   |  9.5 |  8   |
| Elon Musk      |  4   |  8   |  7   |  3   |  6   |
|  Melba Mouton  |  10  |  10  |  7   |  10  |  11  |
|Malala Yousafzai|  9.5 |  9   |  9.5 |  8   |  7   |
| Steve Jobs     |  9.5 |  8   |  9   |  10  |  9   |
| Lionel Messi   |  10  |  10  |  10  |  10  |  10  |
| Mohamed Salah  |  11  |  11  |  11  |  11  |  11  |
